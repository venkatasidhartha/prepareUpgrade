REST APIs

1. What is REST and how does it work?
    REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications, primarily web services. 
    RESTful services use standard HTTP methods and principles to enable communication between client and server.

    How Does REST Work?
        REST Works by defining a set of constraints and principles that structure how how the web services should communicate.

        1. Stateless Communication
            Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
             The server does not store any state about the client session on the server side. This makes REST services scalable and
              simplifies server design.
        
        2. Client-Server Architecture
            REST adheres to a client-server architecture where the client and server are separate and can evolve independently. 
            The client handles the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage and business logic.
        
        3. Uniform Interface
            RESTful systems have a uniform interface that simplifies and decouples the architecture, 
            enabling each part to evolve independently. The uniform interface is defined by four key constraints:

            Resource Identification in Requests: Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). 
            Each resource can be accessed using a unique URI.
            
            Example
            GET /books/123

            Manipulation of Resources Through Representations: Clients manipulate resources using representations 
            (typically JSON or XML). For example, to update a resource, the client sends a representation of the resource 
            with the necessary changes.

            Example 
            PUT /books/123
            Content-Type: application/json

            {
                "title": "Updated Book Title",
                "author": "Updated Author Name"
            }

            Self-Descriptive Messages: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. 
            This includes metadata like content type and HTTP methods.

            Example
            POST /books
            Content-Type: application/json

            {
                "title": "New Book Title",
                "author": "Author Name"
            }

            Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): Clients interact with a network of resources by 
            following hypermedia links provided dynamically by the server.
        
        4. HTTP Methods
            RESTful services use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
            Methods : GET,POST,PUT,DELETE

        5. Layered System
            A RESTful system can have multiple layers, with each layer having specific functionality and responsibilities. 
            This modular approach allows for scalability and flexibility. For example, one layer could handle security 
            (authentication and authorization), while another handles caching.
        
        6. Cacheable Responses
            Responses from the server are defined as cacheable or non-cacheable, allowing clients to reuse responses for 
            subsequent requests, improving performance and reducing load on the server.
        
    Summary
        REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing scalable and stateless web services. 
        It leverages standard HTTP methods and principles, such as stateless communication, client-server architecture, 
        uniform interface, and layered system. RESTful services are designed around resources identified by URIs and manipulated 
        through representations using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This approach ensures simplicity, 
        scalability, and flexibility in web service design.
    

2. How do you design a RESTful API?

    To design a api it has several steps

    1. Identify the Resources
        Identify the main resources that your API will expose. Resources are typically nouns and represent entities in your system.

        Example:
            Users
            Books
            Orders
    
    2. Define the URIs
        Define the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for your resources. Each resource should have a unique URI that represents it.

        Example:
            /users - A collection of users
            /users/{id} - A specific user
    
    3. Use HTTP Methods
        Use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on the resources.

        Methods
            GET: Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
            POST: Create a new resource.
            PUT: Update an existing resource.
            DELETE: Delete a resource.

    4. Design the Data Representation
        Decide on the format for data representation, typically JSON or XML. JSON is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of use.

        Example:
            {
                "id": 1,
                "title": "RESTful API Design",
                "author": "John Doe",
                "published_date": "2024-01-01"
            }
    
    5. Use Proper HTTP Status Codes
        Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the API request.

        Example:

            200 OK - The request was successful.
            201 Created - A new resource was successfully created.
            204 No Content - The request was successful but there is no content to return.
            400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
            401 Unauthorized - Authentication failed or user does not have permissions.
            404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found.
            500 Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server.

    6. Implement Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting
        For endpoints that return a collection of resources, implement pagination, filtering, and sorting to manage large datasets
        and improve performance.

        Example:
            Pagination: GET /books?page=1&limit=10
            Filtering: GET /books?author=John+Doe
            Sorting: GET /books?sort=published_date
    
    7. Handle Authentication and Authorization
        Secure your API by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or API keys.

        Example:
            GET /books
            Authorization: Bearer <token>
    
    8. Provide Error Handling and Responses
        Ensure that your API provides meaningful error messages and responses for different error conditions.

        Example:
            {
            "error": {
                "code": 400,
                "message": "Invalid request: 'title' field is required."
            }
            }
    9. Document the API
        Provide comprehensive documentation for your API, including details on endpoints, request/response formats, authentication,
        and examples.


3. What are some best practices for REST API development?
    2 question and this is same.


4. How do you handle authentication in a REST API?
    Authentication in a REST API is essential to ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources and 
    perform specific actions. Here are the common methods to handle authentication in a REST API:

    1. API Keys
        API keys are simple tokens that a client provides when making API calls. 
        They are usually included in the request header or as a query parameter.

        How it Works:
            The client includes the API key in the request header.
            The server verifies the API key and grants access if valid.

        Example:
            GET /api/resource
            Authorization: Api-Key abc123xyz
        
        Pros:
            Simple to implement.
            Suitable for server-to-server communication.
        Cons:
            Limited security (e.g., susceptible to interception if not used with HTTPS).
            No built-in mechanism for user-specific permissions.

    2. Basic Authentication
        Basic Authentication uses the HTTP header to send a Base64-encoded string containing the username and password.
        
        How it Works:
            The client sends the username and password encoded in Base64 in the request header.
            The server decodes and verifies the credentials.

        Example:
            GET /api/resource
            Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
        
        Pros:
            Simple and straightforward.
        Cons:
            Credentials are sent with every request.
            Must be used with HTTPS to ensure security.

    3. Token-Based Authentication
        Token-based authentication uses tokens (e.g., JWT) instead of credentials to authenticate requests.

        How it Works:
            The client sends a login request with credentials.
            The server verifies the credentials and returns a token.
            The client includes the token in subsequent requests.
            The server validates the token to authenticate the user.

        Example:
            POST /api/login
            Content-Type: application/json

            {
            "username": "user",
            "password": "pass"
            }

            # Response
            {
            "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
            }

            # Subsequent request with token
            GET /api/resource
            Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

        Pros:
            More secure as credentials are not sent with each request.
            Tokens can have expiration times and be revoked.
        Cons:
            Token management adds complexity.

    4. OAuth 2.0
        OAuth 2.0 is a robust framework for token-based authentication and authorization, 
        often used for allowing third-party applications to access user data.

        How it Works:
            The client requests authorization from the user.
            The user authenticates and authorizes the client.
            The client receives an authorization grant.
            The client exchanges the authorization grant for an access token.
            The client includes the access token in requests to access protected resources.

        Example:
                GET /authorize
                Response: Authorization grant

                POST /token
                Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

                {
                "grant_type": "authorization_code",
                "code": "authorization_code",
                "redirect_uri": "http://client.com/callback",
                "client_id": "client_id",
                "client_secret": "client_secret"
                }

                # Response
                {
                "access_token": "access_token",
                "token_type": "Bearer",
                "expires_in": 3600,
                "refresh_token": "refresh_token"
                }

                # Subsequent request with access token
                GET /api/resource
                Authorization: Bearer access_token

        Pros:
            Suitable for user authentication and authorization.
            Scalable and secure.
            Widely adopted and supported.
        Cons:
            More complex to implement.

    5. Session-Based Authentication
        In session-based authentication, the server creates a session for the user upon successful login and returns a session ID,
        which the client includes in subsequent requests.

        How it Works:
            The client sends a login request with credentials.
            The server creates a session and returns a session ID.
            The client includes the session ID in the request headers or cookies.

        Example:
            POST /login
            Content-Type: application/json

            {
            "username": "user",
            "password": "pass"
            }

            # Response
            Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; HttpOnly

            # Subsequent request with session ID
            GET /api/resource
            Cookie: session_id=abc123

        Pros:
            Simplifies client-side logic.
            Server-side control over sessions.
        Cons:
            Less scalable due to server-side session storage.
            Requires stateful server.

    Summary
        Handling authentication in a REST API can be achieved through various methods, each with its pros and cons:

        API Keys: Simple but less secure, suitable for server-to-server communication.
        Basic Authentication: Easy to implement but should be used with HTTPS for security.
        Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT): More secure, tokens can be managed and expired.
        OAuth 2.0: Robust and scalable, ideal for third-party access.
        Session-Based Authentication: Simplifies client logic, but requires stateful servers.
